# Peter Perez - Fab Academy documentation

Right now this is a clone of my Fab Academy site, but will evolve into my personal website.

Visit [fabacademy.org](https://fabacademy.org/) for class and other information.

Good day and welcome to Peter Perez's Fab Academy Portfolio and more. Here we will be tracking my journey with the Moonlighter Fablab through this program. 

This website was coded simply using HTML, CSS, some help from ChatGPT and Dall-E and a lot of elbow grease. 

I hope you like what you see and learn with me!

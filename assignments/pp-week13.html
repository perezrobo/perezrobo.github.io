    <h2>Finally, I can learn how I2C works</h2>
    <p>When I watched last week's class and noticed what we were doing this week I already knew what this week's assignment would be: figuring out I2C</p>
    <p>I have spent many years teaching Arduino content but at a surface level and it always comes up, what do these extra letters on the chip mean? I would respond as probably not many teachers do: I have no idea but for right now it doesn't matter. And then go on with my day. That same philosophy kept going until I reached this point in time where my project depended on I2C working... Well thats an opportunity if I have ever seen one.</p>
    <p>The first thing I needed to do was figure out what I2C was. So I watched a few videos that were far too technical for the amount of time I had but elucidating on the basics.</p>
    <img src="../images/week13/I2C Basics.jpg">
    <p>Credit to the <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/an/sbaa565/sbaa565.pdf?ts=1714512611394&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F">Texas Instruments guide to I2C</a> for this diagram</p>
    <p>But in essence, every I2C device is connected to one main device, and then all the other ones are connected on one wire together, well two. SDA - Serial Data, and SCL, Serial Clock. These are then both pulled up to 5V or whatever power is by a pull up resistor because I2C only pulls down. This prevents things from getting a little messy and interfering with each other.</p>
    <p>Now my question was the one that I am sure many people have. How do I talk to individual devices if they are connected on one wire? I have only done 1:1. Well. Like little houses in a row, they each have an address.</p>
    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/dronebotworkshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/i2c-address-conflict.jpeg?w=768&ssl=1">
    <p>Like in this image by <a href="https://dronebotworkshop.com/multiple-i2c-bus/">DroneBotWorkshop</a> each one of the different devices has a different code that can be 7,8, or 10 bit. Though most protocols use a 7 bit number. In my case I knew the address of one of my devices, the <strong>Mu Vision Sensor</strong> that I used in <a href="../assignments/pp-week11.html">Input Week</a> Because that device has switches that can set the I2C Address I set that one to 0x60. Now I needed to find the addresses of the screen and the Servo controller I had. I am not going to use this controller, but I am doing it to see what 3 I2C devices look like because I have a distance sensor that is still coming in the mail.</p>

  <h2>Learning the Addresses to my Devices</h2>
  <p>Like every week I did what any good creator does. I looked on youtube to see if someone had solved my problem first. And luckily someone had. There exists an I2C scanner for Arduino that I could run using these devices.</p>
  <p>In my searches I found the video below:</p>

  <!-- I2C Scanner-->

  <p>Using a simple Breadboard you can build an I2C scanner to get the addresses for all of your devices. I felt like this would come in handy so I copied the video's wiring diagram and then used the breadboard to plug in my peripherals. It ended up looking something like this:</p>
  <img src="../images/week13/IMG_7264 Medium.jpeg">
  <p>I know it is an abomination of wires so here is a nicer diagram of the project:</p>
  <img>
  <p>After doing this I ran the code that was attached to the video above. If you would like to run it yourself you can find the .ino file here:</p>
  <a href="../files/week13/i2c_scanner.ino">I2C Scanner.ino</a>
  <p>As long as all your cables are connected right you will get an output that looks like this:</p>
  <img src="../images/week13/IMG_7263 Medium.jpeg">
  <p>In this image I had only attached the screen and the servo controller so I decided to add the camera to see if there was any change in the output. Lo and Behold it was truly working!</p>
  <img src="../images/week13/IMG_7265 Medium.jpeg">
  <p>So due to the order I plugged them in I found out I was dealing with the following addresses: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>0x3c: Screen</li>
    <li>0x40 AND 0x70: Servo Controller</li>
    <li>0x60: Mu Vision Sensor</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="week-content text-center">
  <h2>Working with more than one I2C device</h2>
  <p>Now I had to figure out how to work with two I2C Devices at once and have them work properly. So I set out a simple goal:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Get the screen to react to a camera input</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Luckily I already had code for both of these found in Input week and Output week. When I looked closely at the code I had found online I used these two I2C devices separately and had defined them as such. So how could I go about putting them together. What I did was slice and dice the code into one segment. Because of the bitmaps it would be unwieldy to paste the code directly into the website so instead I will paste in chunks and explain them. Or if you want to scroll through them you can download the whole code here:</p>

   <!-- The System Working! -->

  <h3>What are you seeing?</h3>
  <p>Here what is happening is that when the Mu Vision Sensor sees a person, it triggers an event which causes the eyes of the system to look "scared." If no human is detected, the screen is just looking casually. This is a great first step for my project because I want the robot to react to the presence of a person.</p>

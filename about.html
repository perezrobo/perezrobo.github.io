              <h3>A Bit</h3>
              <p>My name is Peter, and the first thing you'll probably notice about me is that I am pretty tall. Once we get past all that you'll probably ask the usual, and find out I am a Cuban American with an affinity for good strong coffee (with espumita) and freshly baked bread. </p>
              <p>For my day job I am the Associate STEAM Director at Belen Jesuit Prep School down in Miami, Fl. Nowadays I spend most of my time in the fablab tinkering with robots and multitudes of creations teaching students to do the same.</p>
               <p>On my off time I read, build, cook, adventure, and explore whatever strange idea may pop in my head (last week it was those protein bagels people were making on instagram).</p>

              <h3>A Byte</h3>
              <p>Now, for the longer story in case that last one peaked your interest. I was born and raised in Miami, Fl and had an affinity for making and tinkering from a young age. My mother told me that she knew any car or toy that she bought me would be taken apart within 48 hours, I believe her. That process continued to grow and evolve through my life, except we can add in putting things back together to my repertoire a few short years after that. This natural curiousity led me to explore engineering and associated careers for my future.</p>
              <p>After a few difficult speed bumps in life I found myself in the University of Miami -GO CANES- studying Biomedical Engineering. I planned on building prosthetics. I mean, it was 2008 an Ironman had just come out, what else was there for a young Engineer to do? But life likes to take its turns and instead I ended up focusing on cell and tissue engineering in Dr. Cheung's lab. I started a PhD in the topic and though vastly interesting, I definitely learned that is not what I wanted to do with my life. I became a call center agent, learned how to talk to people that don't want to talk to me. And then I received a fateful call from a friend who asked if I wanted to be a teacher. I said no. Then said well, what is the worst that can happen? (hint, 10 years later I am still a teacher).</p>
              <p>I started teaching Biology and Physical Science and due to my background became the understudy for the FIRST Tech Challenge robotics coach. This is where I finally got to do the engineering I wanted to do as a child. Again fate lended its hand and I was offered the position of engineering teacher and to take over the engineering lab. That is the best thing that could have happened to me. I went back to school, UCF this time --GO KNIGHTS-- and started a master's degree in mechanical engineering, my truer passion. But pragmatism, and the fact that I was studying and working at the same time led me to a degree in Industrial Engineering instead with half of the credits in mechanical.</p>
              <p>My work at the first school led me to the job I have today. The Associate STEAM Director at Belen Jesuit. This job also led me to finally work with the fablab I am doing this program with, the Moonlighter Fablab. Fun fact, I had looked them up when I worked my first job and wanted to collaborate but never found the time or support to do so. But God works in mysterious ways and I was led right back. Thank God too because now we have been able to do a lot of cool things and hopefully will continue to do so through this program and in the greater Miami area.</p>
              <p>My goal is to make sure that people know how to make things so that they can make the world a better place. The Fab Academy is a great way to keep this project going!</p>
